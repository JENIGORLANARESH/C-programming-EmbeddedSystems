# Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are a combination of **hardware** and **software** that work together to perform a specific function. They are composed of:

- **Hardware (HW)**: The physical components of the system, such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, and System-on-Chips (SoCs).
- **Software (SW)**: The programs and operating systems that run on the hardware.
- **Firmware**: Permanent software stored in the systemâ€™s memory, often responsible for low-level control of the device.

## Microcontroller-Based Devices

Examples of devices that typically use microcontrollers:

- Washing machines  
- Microwave ovens  
- Air conditioners  
- TV remotes

## Microprocessor-Based Devices

Examples of devices that commonly use microprocessors:

- Personal computers (PCs)  
- Laptops  
- Drones  
- CT scanners

## SoC (System-on-Chip) Based Devices

Devices that often use SoCs include:

- Smart TVs  
- Smartphones  
- Surveillance cameras

|    > Measures at cycles/sec                |    Clock Speed : 1GHz to 5GHz            |
|    > Designed by Intel in 1980             |    Used in desktop, laptops, high end systems    |
|    > Advanced version runs at 22MHz to 80MHz   |  1GHz = 1024MHz                    |
| 2) **ATmega2560**                           |   2) **Intel SBC's (Single Board Computers)**  |
|    > It is a microcontroller made by Atmel in 1998  |    > Used in defence, Aerospace, Medtech  |
|    > *Arduino* is a HW & SW platform that uses the ATmega2560  |
|    > It runs at 16MHz                       |

|    > Runs at 12MHz
|    > Adv version run at 88MHz
|    > Developed by Armholdings in 1990
|    > Most of the microcontroller runs below 100MHz
