# String

- A string in C is a sequence of characters terminated by a null character '\0'.
- It is represented as an array of characters.

## Range of values that can be stored in a character variable?

- Ans : It depends on SIGN Qualifier
  - signed
  - unsigned
  - Example : unsigned char ch; signed char ch;
  - If you dont apply any sign qualifier, by default "signed" will apply.

### Signed char ch;

- +ve , -ve
  - can store both positive and negative
- MSB is treated as sign bit

- Range : -128 < - > 0 < - > 127

### Unsigned char ch;

- +ve only
- MSB is not treated as sign bit
- Range : 0 -> 255
- 2 ^ 8 = 256

## Signed char

```
        char ch = 127;
        ch = ch + 1;
        printf( "%d" , ch );    //output : -128

        ch = 127;
        ch = ch + 3;
        printf( "%d" , ch );    //output : -126

        ch = -128;
        ch = ch - 1;
        printf( "%d" , ch );    //output : 127
```

- char ch = 127;
- ch = ch + 1; // ch = 128

1. checks if the result is within the range
2. Result 128 is not within the range -128 to 127
3. Result has exceed the maximum value in the range by 1;
4. once you exceed the maximum value in the range "WRAP AROUND" occurs
5. Once Wrap around occurs counting again starts from "minimum value" in the range

<br>

- char ch = -128;
- ch = ch - 1; // ch = -129

1. Result is not within the range
2. Result has gone below the minimum value in the range by 1
3. Once the result goes below the minimum value in the range "WRAP AROUND" occurs
4. Once wrap around occurs counting again starts from maximum value 127

## Unsigned char ( 0 - 255)

```
        unsigned char ch = 255;
        ch = ch + 1;

        // ch = 256 -> wrong
        // ch = 0   -> correct
```

1. 256 is not within
2. range result has exceeded the max value in range by 1
3. once result exceeds the max value wrap around occurs
4. once wrap around occurs counting starts from min value

```
        unsigned char ch;
        ch = 0;
        ch = ch - 1;
        //  ch = -1    wrong
        //  ch = 255   correct
```
