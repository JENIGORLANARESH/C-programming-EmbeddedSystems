# vi editor
* vi - has two operation modes
1)  Insert mode
        *   Write c programs, statements
2)  Command mode
        *   Administative taks (save, exit, cut, copy, paste, search)
        *   In this mode we cannot write c programs

*   vi-editor by default opens in command mode
#### How to shift from command mode to insert mode
        *   i - special key(press)
        *   --INSERT--  (string appears at bottom left)

*   The new statements is not immediately save to file present in hard disk
*   sample.c    ->  files are stored in HardDisk/Secondary Memory / Mass storage Device in PC

#### Embedded Device

1)  Primary Memory      ->      RAM 
2)  Secondary Memory    ->      files are stored
    -   Internal    ->  flash
    -   External    ->  SD card, MicroSD

### How to save new statements to file present in Hard Disk
    
    * save operation (Administration task) -> command mode

####    Insert mode     ->      Command mode
    *   press "ESP" special key to shift from insert mode to command mode

### Save Operation
```
    :w<ENTER>
```
    -   :w < ENTER >    (It appears at bottom left)
    -   New statements are saved to file in hard disk

### Exit / Quit
```
    :q<ENTER>
```
    - To exit from vi editor

## Create a exectable file with different name
    * $gcc sample.c
        -   creates executable file name a.out
```
    $gcc sample.c -o sample
```
    * -o        ->  flag
    * sample    ->  exutable file name

* Execution
```
    $./sample
```

    * For information on -o goto $man gcc

###     :w + :q     ->      :wq     (save & exit)   ->  :x
*   For save & exit instead of :wq we can use :x

###     save & exit ->  :w + :q     (or)    :wq     (or)    :x

####    Dont save & exit    ->  :q!

#  copy & paste    (Administrative Tasks)(command mode)

*   Copy a single line      ->  yy  (yanked or copy)
*   Pasting a single line   ->  p
*   Copy two lines          ->  2yy
*   paste 2 lines           ->  p
*   copy 4 lines            ->  4yy
*   If you copy more than 2 lines a notification appears at the bottom left handside corner
    Ex : 3 lines yanked
*   If you paste more than 2 lines a notification appears at the bottom left handside corner

###   Copy & Paste - Single Word
    *   copy single word    -   yw
    *   paste a single word -   p
    *   copy two words      -   2yw
    *   paste two words     -   p

##   Delete
    *   delete a single line    -   dd
    *   delete 4 lines          -   4dd
    *   If you delete more than 2 lines a notification will appear at the bottom left hand side
        Ex : 6 fewer lines

#     Search

```
        /<string_name> <Enter>
```
    * cases jumps to first instance of string

#### NOTE :
    *   search operation is case sensitive

*   Uppercase and Lowercase have different ASCII values
*   A   ->  65
*   a   ->  97
####    How to find second instance?
*   search forward      ->  n   (next)
*   search backward     ->  shift + n

```
        $man printf
        $man scanf
        $man sleep
```

##  System Calls

*   System calls are functions provided by the operating system that allow user-level programs to request services from the kernel â€” the core part of the OS.

*   In simple terms:    <br>

    System calls are the gateway between your program and the operating system.

*   There are 320+ systems calls.
*   Example :   open() , read() , signal() , write()

* Application uses system calls to send request to kernel space drivers

### Types

1)  Process Management Subsystem
2)  Memory management subsystem
3)  File management subsystem
4)  Device i/o  management subsystem
5)  Netword management subsystem

### Can a application send request directly to a device?
Ans : Application can never send request directly to a device

*   Device can never send request to application.

### Who can initiate an Input / Output request?
    * Device drivers cannot request an i/o request
    * Application can start an i/o request by using system calls and request comes to device drivers
    * Device can initiate i/o request by using Hardware interrupts.

## Paste
    *   p (small)   ->  copied line pasted "below" current line(cursor)
    *   P (Capital) ->  copied line pasted "above" current line(cursor)

## Command mode     to      insert mode

###     i ,  o (lowercase)
    1) shift from cmd mode to insert mode
    2) creates a new empty line below the current line
###     O (Uppercase)
    1) shifts from cmd mode to insert mode
    2) creates a new empty line above the current line

#### How to jump cursor to last line?
Ans : G

#### shift cursor to first line
Ans : gg

#### shift cursor to 25th line
Ans : 25< ENTER > <br>
      25G
      25gg

### Note :
    To exit from "man" command documentation use -> q
