# Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are a combination of **hardware** and **software** that work together to perform a specific function. They are composed of:

- **Hardware (HW)**: The physical components of the system, such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, and System-on-Chips (SoCs).
- **Software (SW)**: The programs and operating systems that run on the hardware.
- **Firmware**: Permanent software stored in the systemâ€™s memory, often responsible for low-level control of the device.

## Microcontroller-Based Devices

Examples of devices that typically use microcontrollers:

- Washing machines  
- Microwave ovens  
- Air conditioners  
- TV remotes

## Microprocessor-Based Devices

Examples of devices that commonly use microprocessors:

- Personal computers (PCs)  
- Laptops  
- Drones  
- CT scanners

## SoC (System-on-Chip) Based Devices

Devices that often use SoCs include:

- Smart TVs  
- Smartphones  
- Surveillance cameras
