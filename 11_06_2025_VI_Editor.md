# vi editor
* vi - has two operation modes
1)  Insert mode
        *   Write c programs, statements
2)  Command mode
        *   Administative taks (save, exit, cut, copy, paste, search)
        *   In this mode we cannot write c programs

*   vi-editor by default opens in command mode
#### How to shift from command mode to insert mode

        *   --INSERT--  (string appears at bottom left)

*   The new statements is not immediately save to file present in hard disk
*   sample.c    ->  files are stored in HardDisk/Secondary Memory / Mass storage Device in PC

#### Embedded Device

2)  Secondary Memory    ->      files are stored

### Exit / Quit

    - To exit from vi editor

## Create a exectable file with different name
    * $gcc sample.c
        -   creates executable file name a.out
```
    $gcc sample.c -o sample
```
    * -o        ->  flag
    * sample    ->  exutable file name

* Execution
```
    $./sample
```

    * For information on -o goto $man gcc

###     :w + :q     ->      :wq     (save & exit)   ->  :x
*   For save & exit instead of :wq we can use :x
