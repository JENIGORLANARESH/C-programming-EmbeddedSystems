# Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are a combination of Hardware and Software that work together to perform a specific function.
They are made up of:

* **Hardware (HW)**: The physical components of the system, such as Microcontrollers, Microprocessors, and SOC's.
* **Software (SW)**: The programs and operating systems that run on the hardware.
* **Firmware**: The permanent software that is stored in the system's memory.
