# 📘 Introduction to Embedded Systems

## 🧠 What is an Embedded System?

An **Embedded System** is a combination of **hardware (HW)** and **software (SW)** designed to perform a specific function or a set of functions within a larger system.

The software in embedded systems is often referred to as **firmware**.

## 🔍 Key Components

### Hardware:
- **Microcontroller** – Self-contained unit with CPU, memory, I/O
- **Microprocessor** – CPU only; needs external components
- **SoC (System on Chip)** – Combines CPU, memory, I/O, and more into one chip

### Software:
- Referred to as **firmware**
- Stored in ROM, Flash, or EEPROM
- Written in C or Assembly for performance and control
