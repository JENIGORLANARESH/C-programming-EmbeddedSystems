# Declaring a Pointer

### Syntax for Declaring a Pointer in C

```c
type *pointerName;

// Example:
int *ptr;
char *chPtr;
float *fPtr;
```

* Pointers are used to store addresses.
* Adress is always 32-bit in 32-bit architecture
* A pointer which contains Garbage value is called "WILD POINTER"
* A pointer which contains 0's is called "NULL POINTER"

# Assigning a valid Address

## Syntax
##      sptr = &sval;

```
        short sval = 25;
        short *sptr;
        sptr = &sval;
//              0xb7427800      We have 2 Bytes of valid address
```

# Dereferencing
## Syntax
##      *pointer
##      *(0xb7437800)
