# Declaring a Pointer

### Syntax

```c
data_type *pointerName;
```

### Example:
```
int *ptr;
char *chPtr;
float *fPtr;
```

* Pointers are used to store addresses.
* Adress is always 32-bit in 32-bit architecture
* A pointer which contains Garbage value is called "WILD POINTER"
* A pointer which contains 0's is called "NULL POINTER"

# Assigning a valid Address

### Syntax
```
     sptr = &sval;
```
### Example
```
        short sval = 25;
        short *sptr;
        sptr = &sval;
//              0xb7427800      We have 2 Bytes of valid address
```

# Dereferencing
### Syntax

```
      *pointer
      *(0xb7437800)
```
### Example

```
        short sval = 25;
        short *sptr;
        sptr = &sval;
        printf( "%d" , sval );          -> 25
        printf( "%d" , *sptr );         -> 25
        printf( "%p" , &sval );         -> 0xb7427800
        printf( "%p" , sptr );          -> 0xb7427800
```

* Once you apply * to address we will get access to memory at that address
* From this base address we can access 2 Bytes
* Base type of sptr is short
