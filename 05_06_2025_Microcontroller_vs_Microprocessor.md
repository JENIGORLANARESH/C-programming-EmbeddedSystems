# Microcontroller vs Microprocessor Notes

## Memory Requirements
- *Microcontroller:*
  - Very less memory required (from KBs to MBs).
- *Microprocessor:*
  - Requires more memory (MBs to GBs).

## Operating System
- *Microcontroller:*
  - No operating system (OS).
  - Note: Cannot run a full-fledged embedded OS on a microcontroller-based device.
- *Microprocessor:*
  - Supports OS like Windows, Linux, MacOS.

## Definitions
- Microcontroller in short is called *MCU*.

## Hardware Connections
- *Microcontrollers:*
  - All components are contained in a *single chip*.
- *Microprocessors:*
  - Components like memory, I/O controllers, and timers are connected through physical lines called *BUS*.

# Block Diagram of Microcontroller
- *Components:*
  - CPU (up to ~16 MHz)
  - Memory:
    - RAM
    - ROM (Settings)
  - I/O Ports (GPIO, USB, I2C, SPI, etc.)
  - Timers
  - A2D (Analog to Digital) / D2A (Digital to Analog) converters
- *Note:* All components are integrated into a *single chip*.

# Block Diagram of Microprocessor
- *CPU (High Speed ~1 GHz to 3.6 GHz)*
  - ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
  - Registers
  - Timing
  - Control Unit
- *Interface through Buses:*
  - Address Bus
  - Data Bus
  - Control Bus
- *External Components:*
  - RAM
  - ROM
  - I/O Ports (SATA, USB, Serial I/O, etc.)
  - Timers/Counters
